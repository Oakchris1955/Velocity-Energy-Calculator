# Relative kinetic energy calculator

A simple Python program to calculate kinetic energy according to Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Also works with pretty small velocities (for example, 1 meter per second)

## Installation

1) Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Clone the repository using `git` or just download it using the green button saying `Code` and unzip it
3) That's it, you are done. Since all module all modules used here are prebuilt in Python, you don't have to install anything else

## Usage

Either run the program directly and input the parameters or pass them via the command line (first argument is velocity, second is mass)
